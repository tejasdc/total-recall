# Total Recall (POC)

A spaced repetition learning app that helps you remember anything long-term by automatically generating flashcards from your content and intelligently scheduling reviews.

## Overview

Total Recall transforms your PDFs into smart flashcards using AI, then uses spaced repetition algorithms to help you retain knowledge over the long term. Instead of manually creating flashcards, simply upload your content and let the app do the work.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Content**: Provide a PDF document containing the information you want to remember
2. **AI Generation**: The app automatically generates question-answer flashcards from your content
3. **Study Sessions**: Review the generated flashcards, attempting to recall the answer before revealing it
4. **Rate Your Recall**: After seeing the answer, rate how well you remembered it
5. **Smart Scheduling**: Based on your rating, the app determines the optimal time to show you that card again

## Core Concept

The app leverages the spaced repetition algorithm to optimize your learning. Cards you struggle with appear more frequently, while cards you know well are shown less often. This scientifically-proven approach maximizes retention while minimizing study time.

## Target Users

Currently designed for individuals who want to:
- Remember information from books, articles, or study materials long-term
- Transform passive reading into active learning
- Build lasting knowledge without the tedious work of creating flashcards manually

## POC Features

- PDF upload and processing
- Automatic Q&A flashcard generation using AI
- Spaced repetition scheduling based on user performance
- Simple review interface with self-rating system

## Project Status

This is a proof of concept (POC) exploring the effectiveness of combining AI-generated flashcards with spaced repetition for long-term knowledge retention.
